# Language-as-Data

For this assignment, I chose to work with the Hugging Face dataset, accessible at the following link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/werent4/lithuanian-translations/viewer/en-lt. This dataset contains sentences translated from English to Lithuanian.

The dataset is provided in the files train-00000-of-00001.parquet and train-00000-of-00001.csv.

The Jupyter Notebook Dataset analysis.ipynb includes basic analyses of the dataset to investigate the following properties: average sentence length, vocabulary size and most frequent words, and POS tags.
